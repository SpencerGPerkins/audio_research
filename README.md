# Explorations of audio for classification 

### I am focusing for now on urban sound classification using the UrbanSound8K dataset.

### As of now, this repo consists of a script for applying three different transformations onto one sample from each of the 10 classes in the UrbanSound8K dataset. (transformations.py)

### The repo also contains the data I used, as well as metadata csv for loading/labeling data. 

### Further, I have included some sample figures.
